Best Data structure for orderd groups:
 We can use orderd array and use binary search to search array at O(log n)
 But insertion and deletion will be slow as it pushing is needed and thus only do in linear time

 Binary Search Tree is another good one
 Searching will be at O(log n)
 Insertion is also at O(log n)

 Insertion of sorted element will make tree unbalanced

 should make balance in tree by make suring left and right of node have same highest

 Finding Minimun and maximum, Median , Order are easy in Binary tree
