3*10^9 ACGTs are identical in human genome
only 3*10^6 are different(Rare)
Only 100 private mutatutions
When a varient is find its more likely a common varient and less likely private mutation
There is massive raw data in genomics:
    Mapping many short reads to a long geenome sequence:
        Taking short strings from different position and map it to reference
    Finding mismatches
        indexing every posible combination of 5 combination(Dictionary order) of TGA and indexing each position
        help to find the match easy 
    Topic Summary

Most of the DNA of a person is identical
Bt DNA can be used to find the a persons risk to diseases
